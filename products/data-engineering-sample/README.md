# Retail Sales Data Engineering Sample Project

This sample project demonstrates a complete retail sales data engineering workflow with:

- **Data ingestion**: reading raw sales and product CSV files
- **Data quality checks**: validating date formats, duplicates, and required fields
- **Transformation**: standardizing product categories, calculating daily revenue, and building a fact sales table
- **Analytics-ready output**: saving cleaned datasets for reporting or dashboard use

## Files

- `ingest_and_transform.py` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â sample Python ETL script
- `sample_data/` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â sample input CSV files
- `output/` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â generated output datasets (not committed)

## How to run

```bash
python ingest_and_transform.py
```

The script saves cleaned and modeled CSV outputs in `output/` for review or import into analytics tools.
